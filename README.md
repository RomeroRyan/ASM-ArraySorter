# ASM Array Sorter
- Ryan Romero         r.romero.softwaredev@gmail.com

# Project Description
A simple c++ project that incorporates what I learn in x86 assembly with c++. Users can input numbers into an array and have the array be sorted and/or reversed. the sortArray() and reverseArray() functions are written in x86 Assembly.

# ERROR 
C++ does not support the current x86 assembly written in this code. After a bit of research, I would need to translate the current x86 ASM code to GCC Inline Assembly. Due to this limitation, thise code is unable to execute properly. Since I do not learn GCC Inline Assembly, this project is efftively reached a halt. That said, when examining the ASM and the C++ code seporately, they both seem to work as intended.
