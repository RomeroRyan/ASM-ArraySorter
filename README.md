# Project-1
A simple c++ project that incorporates assembly

For my first personal project I decided to create a very short c++ code that will use assembly in 2 of the function calls. This first project, while not impressive, is more of a way for me to experiment with gitHub.

This projects came to be after scoring a great score on on my first ASM assignment that required actual implementation. After doing so, decided to create a code revolving around the ASM code I have writen up.


NOTES:
- as of now, this code is consider LEGACY CODE: it has been years since I last test this code for errors. C++ compiler having trouble recongnizing ASM code
  - TODO: test code on new/updated C++ compiler for errors
