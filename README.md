For my first "project" i decided to create a very short c++ code that will use assembly in one of the function calls. This first project, while not impressive, is more of a way for me to experiment with gitHub.


5/25 NOTES: Having problems understanding why when I push changes from terminal straight to Project1 it done under other account. Will need to find out later
