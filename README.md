# ASM Array Sorter
- Ryan Romero         r.romero.softwaredev@gmail.com

# Project Description
A simple c++ project that incorporates what I learn in x86 assembly with c++. users can input numbers into an array and have the array be sorted and/or reversed. the sortArray() and reverseArray() functions are written in x86 Assembly.


# Limitations
C++ does not support the current x86 assembly written in this code. Would need to translate the current x86 ASM code to GCC Inline Assembly.
